# check-run1 -- Shell script to test arp-scan basic functionality
#
# Author: Roy Hills
# Date: 9 March 2006
#
# This shell script checks that "arp-scan --help" and "arp-scan --version"
# work.  These options don't use much of the arp-scan functionality, so if
# they fail, then there is a fundamental problem with the program.
