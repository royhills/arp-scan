2022-12-10 Roy Hills <royhills@hotmail.com>

	* configure.ac: Set version to 1.10.0.

	* Git: Tagged as 1.10.0

	* ieee-oui.txt: Updated from IEEE website. Total of 47345 MAC/Vendor
	  mappings.

2022-12-01 Roy Hills <royhills@hotmail.com>

	* arp-scan.h: Make cap_status enum values explicit.

	* configure.ac: Set version to 1.10-rc1.

2022-11-25 Roy Hills <royhills@hotmail.com>

	* Makefile.am: Add $(PACKAGE) to the PKGSYSCONFDIR macro definition
	  so arp-scan looks in the correct directory for the mac-vendor.txt
	  file.  Thanks to Richard Hoyle for reporting this bug.

	* error.c, format.c, link-bpf.c, link-dlpi.c, link-packet-socket.c,
	  wrappers.c, utils.c, arp-scan.c: Standardise code formatting.

2022-11-11 Roy Hills <royhills@hotmail.com>

	* Makefile.am: Added install-exec-hook to set the CAP_NET_RAW
	  capability on the arp-scan executable if "setcap" exists and
	  works.  Otherwise falls back to setting the SUID bit.

2022-11-09 Roy Hills <royhills@hotmail.com>

	* check-error, check-options, Makefile.am: Added new tests to check
	  various options and error conditions.

	* arp-scan.c, arp-scan.1.dist: Updated manpage and help text.

	* pre-release-testing.txt: Removed unneeded and outdated file.

2022-11-07 Roy Hills <royhills@hotmail.com>

	* arp-scan.c: Changed C99 "for (int i=0..." syntax to C89
	  "for (i=0..." format. This caused errors with old toolchain e.g.
	  autoconf 2.69/gcc 4.9.2 on Debian Jessie.

	* check-run1: Moved error checks to check-error.

	* check-error: New file to check error conditions.

	* Makefile.am: Updated list of test scripts.

	* check-decode: Check for any hostname, not just "localhost"
	  because not all distros use that name.

	* arp-scan.c, arp-scan.1.dist: Correct the short option letter
	  for the --macfile option.  It was incorectly shown as "O"
	  when it should be "m".

2022-11-06 Roy Hills <royhills@hotmail.com>

	* Makefile.am: Install mac-vendor.txt to $(sysconfdir)/$(PACKAGE)
	  instead of $(pkgdatadir). With a default ./configure this will be
	  /usr/local/etc/arp-scan.  For a binary package it will typically be
	  /etc/arp-scan. This change is because users may add local entries to
	  mac-vendor.txt that they want to preserve between package upgrades.

	* arp-scan.c, arp-scan.1.dist: Update file paths for mac-vendor.txt.

	* NEWS renamed to NEWS.md with NEWS symlink pointing to it.

	* configure.ac, Makefile.am: use $(SED) variable, remove
	  AC_REVISION($Revision$) because git doesn't expand keywords.
	  Add AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR([build-aux]) to declutter top level directory.
	  Changed AC_PREREQ() from 2.61 to 2.69.

2022-11-03 Roy Hills <royhills@hotmail.com>

	* arp-scan.c, arp-scan.h: Don't display long usage message for
	  unrecognised options and other simple issues, but display brief
	  message and exit instead.  A brief error message is clearer than
	  half a page of usage text.

	* check-run1: Added tests for unrecognised option and no target hosts.

2022-11-02 Roy Hills <royhills@hotmail.com>

	* arp-scan.c, arp-scan.1.dist: Change --format short option character
	  from -k to -F. The -F character became free when the --iabfile
	  option was removed, and is a more logical choice.

	  *** This means anyone who has been using the old -k short option ***
	  *** for --format will need to change to the new -F option.       ***

	* arp-scan.c, check-decode: Print warning message for unavailable
	  --format fields in addition to unknown fields.  Updated test.

	* arp-scan.c, check-decode: Only print vendor field if present for
	  the default output format.  Previously it printed NULL if --quiet
	  was specified. Added test to check-decode to check --quiet output.

2022-11-01 Roy Hills <royhills@hotmail.com>

	* arp-scan.h: Increase HASH_TABLE_SIZE from 50,000 to 70,000 due to
	  addition of IEEE MA-M and MA-S registries.  ieee-oui.txt currently
	  contains 47028 entries of 70000 (67.2%).

	* get-oui.1: renamed to get-oui.1.dist with PKGDATADIR substitution.

	* check-ieee-reg: New file to test IEEE registry lookup.

	* Makefile.am: Build man page "get-oui.1" from "get-oui.dist", added
	  check-ieee-reg test.

	* get-oui: Changed IEEE URLs from http to https. This avoids an HTTP
	  redirect from the http to https site.

	* ieee-oui.txt: Updated from IEEE website.

	* strlcat.c: removed. arp-scan only uses strlcpy(), so we don't need
	  to ship replacement source code for strcat() as well.

	* configure.ac, strlcpy.h: Removed references to strlcat.

2022-10-31 Roy Hills <royhills@hotmail.com>

	* get-oui: Changed to fetch registry data from all four IEEE registries
	  (MA-L, MA-M, MA-S and IAB), format appropriately for arp-scan, and
	  concatenate into ieee-oui.
	* get-iab: No longer needed. Replaced with stub script that calls die.
	* Makefile.am, check-decode, check-host-list: Removed get-iab / iabfile
	  references.
	* arp-scan.c, arp-scan.h: Removed --iabfile option.
	* README.md, arp-scan.1.dist, get-oui.1, mac-vendor.5, mac-vendor.txt:
	  Update text to reflect changes.
	* get-iab.1: Removed. No longer needed.
	* ieee-iab.txt: Removed. No longer needed.
	* ieee-oui.txt: Updated to new combined registry format.

2022-10-30 Roy Hills <royhills@hotmail.com>

	* Makefile.am: Build man page "arp-scan.1" from "arp-scan.dist"
	  replacing all occurances of @pkgdatadir@ with the $pkgdatadir
	  variable that is set by configure. This ensures that the file
	  paths in the manpage arp-scan.1 reflect the paths on the system
	  where ./configure was run.
	* arp-scan.1: renamed to arp-scan.1.dist with PKGDATADIR substitution.

2022-10-27 Roy Hills <royhills@hotmail.com>

	* arp-fingerprint.1, arp-scan.1, get-iab.1, get-oui.1, mac-vendor.5:
	  Standardised man page fonts, corrected some inaccuracies and removed
	  author section.

	* Updated ieee-oui.txt and ieee-iab.txt files.

2022-10-25 Roy Hills <royhills@hotmail.com>

	* format.c: New file containing output format functions.

	* Makefile.am: Added format.c source file to arp_scan_SOURCES

	* utils.c: Added name_to_id() and str_ccmp() functions.

	* arp-scan.c, arp-scan.h, arp-scan.1: Add --format option and output
	  fields processing code.

2022-10-24 Roy Hills <royhills@hotmail.com>

	* Makefile.am, check-decode: Added checks to test output format with
	  --rtt, --resolve, different ARP/header address, and locally
	  administered MAC address.

	* pkt-diff-frame-addr.pcap, pkt-local-admin.pcap: New files for
	  above tests.

2022-10-23 Roy Hills <royhills@hotmail.com>

	* arp-scan.c, error.c arp-scan.c, error.c: Changed most fixed-length
	  strings to use dynamic length strings.

	* utils.c: Changed make_message() to assume vsnprintf() behaves
	  according to POSIX. No need to accomodate bugs in ancient glibc
	  versions.

2022-10-09 Roy Hills <royhills@hotmail.com>

	* arp-scan.c: Added POSIX.1e capabilities support.

	* configure.ac, acinclude.m4: Add autoconf tests for Linux libcap
	  POSIX.1e capabilities support. Incremented version to 1.9.9 to
	  reflect addition of POSIX.1e capabilities support.

	* utils.c, arp-scan.h: New functions limit_capabilities() to limit the
	  permitted capabilities, set_capability() to enable and disable
	  capabilities, and drop_capabilities() to permanently drop all
	  capabilities. These functions use libcap if POSIX.1e capabilities
	  are supported otherwise they fall back to setuid() and seteuid().

2022-10-08 Roy Hills <royhills@hotmail.com>

	* Tagged as 1.9.8

	* arp-scan.c: fix bug reported by mrquincle where ARP responses for
	  a host that had timed out was being incorrectly flagged as a
	  duplicate with the warning message "remove_host called on non-live
	  host: SHOULDN'T HAPPEN".

2022-10-07 Roy Hills <royhills@hotmail.com>

	* arp-scan.c, arp.scan.h: New option --resolve (-d) to resolve IP
	  addresses to hostnames. When this option is specified, responding
	  hosts will be displayed as hostnames instead of IP addresses if they
	  can be resolved.

	* my_getopt.c, my_getopt.h: New getopt implementation using bsittler's
	  version from http://xent.com/~bsittler/geocities/.

	* configure.ac: Modified to use new getopt implementation.

2022-10-05 Roy Hills <royhills@hotmail.com>

	* arp-scan.c, arp-scan.1: Documented the exit status when --limit
	  is specified and fewer than the specified number of hosts respond.

2022-10-02 Roy Hills <royhills@hotmail.com>

	* acinclude.m4: fix typo in 'if test "X$CC" != "X"' checks.

2022-09-28 Roy Hills <royhills@hotmail.com>

	* arp-scan.c: Added --limit (-M) option. When this option is
	  given, arp-scan will exit after the specified number of target
	  hosts have responded. Thanks to mirfatif for suggesting this
	  enhancement.

	* arp-scan.c: Don't increment number of responders for duplicate
	  response packets. The number of responders now represents the
	  number of responding hosts rather than the number of response
	  packets.

	* pkt-dup-response.pcap: new file

	* check-decode: Added duplicate response packet checks

	* arp-scan.1: Updated manpage to reflect new --limit option.

2022-09-18 Roy Hills <royhills@hotmail.com>

	* check-decode, check-host-list, check-packet, check-run1: Changed
	  "$srcdir/arp-scan" to "./arp-scan" in test scripts so
	  "make distcheck" succeeds.

	* .github/workflows/c-cpp.yml: Enable "make distcheck" step.

2022-09-14 Roy Hills <royhills@hotmail.com>

	* README.md, .github/workflows/*: Migrated from travis-ci to github
	  actions for CI/CD build check and code coverage report.

	* .travis.yml: removed as no longer needed.

2022-09-11 Roy Hills <royhills@hotmail.com>

	* arp-scan.h, configure.ac, getopt.c, getopt1.c: only include
	  the local replacement getopt header file if the system doesn't
	  support getopt_long_only.  Previously it was being included even
	  if it wasn't required.

	* getopt.h: rename to my_getopt.h.

2022-09-10 Roy Hills <royhills@hotmail.com>

	* acinclude.m4: Replaced obsolete autoconf macros AC_TRY_COMPILE with
	  AC_COMPILE_IFELSE and AC_TRY_LINK with AC_LINK_IFELSE. These macros
	  were obsoleted in autoconf 2.70.

	* strlcat.h: included this new file that was missed out of the previous
	  commit.

2022-09-09 Roy Hills <royhills@hotmail.com>

	* arp-scan.c: Die with error message if hsearch() fails when adding a
	  new entry to the hash table. Previous behaviour was to issue a
	  warning and continue.

	* mt19937ar.c, mt19937ar.h, Makefile.am, arp-scan.h: Update Mersenne Twister
	  random number generator source code to latest version from
	  https://github.com/clibs/mt19937ar

	* strlcat.c, strlcpy.c: Updated from latest OpenBSD source.

	* strlcat.h: New file containing function prototypes for strlcat() and strlcpy().

2022-09-03 Roy Hills <royhills@hotmail.com>

	* arp-scan.c: Allow MAC addresses in mac-vendor.txt to use either lower
	  or uppercase hex digits and ignore any seperator characters e.g. ":"
	  or "-". This allows normal format MAC addresses such as those output
	  by arp-scan to be used directly in the mac-vendor.txt file.

	* mac-vendor.txt: Update comments to reflect code changes.

2022-06-16 Roy Hills <royhills@hotmail.com>

	* get-iab: change IEEE IAB URL to
	  http://standards-oui.ieee.org/iab/iab.txt. Thanks to silex for the
	  pull request.

	* Updated ieee-oui.txt and ieee-iab.txt files.

2021-12-12 Roy Hills <royhills@hotmail.com>

	* arp-scan.c: Limit packet length in callback() to prevent potential
	  buffer overrun in unmarshal_arp_pkt() if network frames larger
	  than expected are received by libpcap. Thanks to @mrquincle for
	  reporting this issue.

2021-11-17 Roy Hills <royhills@hotmail.com>

	* Use getifaddrs() to obtain the interface IP address if it is available
	  and pcap_findalldevs() fails to find the address.

	  This is typically needed for device aliases such as "eth0:0" on Linux
	  which are not supported by pcap_findalldevs() and would previously
	  cause an error.

	* Increment version number to 1.9.8 to reflect code and autoconf
	  changes.

2021-09-09 Roy Hills <royhills@hotmail.com>

	* Retry sending an ARP packet if the packet send function fails with
	  EAGAIN instead of aborting with an error message. High packet send
	  rates can cause sendto() to fail occasionally with EAGAIN due to
	  temporary resource starvation. Thanks to gessel for reporting this
	  problem.

	  --retry-send (default 3) specifies the number of retries.
	  --retry-send-interval (default 10ms) sets the delay between retries.

	* Minor code cleanup to fix spelling, remove trailing whitespace,
	  fix shellcode warnings and update license file.  Thanks to a1346054
	  for the pull request.

	* Updated ieee-oui.txt and ieee-iab.txt files.

2020-07-05 Roy Hills <royhills@hotmail.com>

	* README.md, arp-fingerprint.1, arp-scan.1, get-iab.1, get-oui.1,
	  mac-vendor.5, mac-vendor.txt: Update wiki references to use
	  new URL http://www.royhills.co.uk/wiki/

2019-10-24 Roy Hills <royhills@hotmail.com>

	* configure.ac: Increment version number to 1.9.7 in preparation for
	  new release.

	* configure.ac, acinclude.m4: Tidy up: remove obsolescent and unused
          autoconf macros.

	* Modified copyright statement in files to include up to 2019.

2019-10-20 Roy Hills <royhills@hotmail.com>

	* arp-scan.c: Call the pcap functions before get_hardware_address() to
	  ensure lack of permissions is reported by pcap_activate() rather
          than by the link specific get_hardware_address().  This will give
	  consistent error messages across different platforms.

	  Improve diagnostic message for pcap_activate() errors and warnings.

	* arp-scan.h: Changed pcap_set_timeout() value from 0 to 1000ms.
          Removed ARRAY_SIZE macro which is no longer used.

	* .gitignore: Added config.h.in~ to .gitignore.

2019-10-13 Roy Hills <royhills@hotmail.com>

	* arp-scan.c: Call pcap_set_immediate_mode() on the pcap handle so
	  captured packets are processed immediately.  This pcap function was
	  added in libpcap 1.5.0, so this and future versions of arp-scan
	  require libpcap 1.5.0 or later.  Thanks for @cleoo for reporting the
	  bug in arp-scan 1.9.5 on Arch Linux 2019.10.01 x64, and to
	  @guyharris for providing the solution.

	* arp-scan.c: Remove ioctl workarounds for BSD with BPF and Solaris
	  with DLPI that were used to ensure immediate packet delivery.  These
	  workarounds are superseded by pcap_set_immediate_mode().

	* wrappers.c: New function my_lookupdev() to replace pcap_lookupdev()
	  which is depreciated in libpcap 1.9.0 and later.

	* configure.ac: Remove ARP_PCAP_BPF and ARP_PCAP_DLPI defines, as these
	  are no longer used after the removal of the ioctl workarounds.

	* configure.ac: Change pcap compatibility test to check for
	  pcap_set_immediate_mode instead of pcap_create to test for libpcap
	  1.5.0 or later.

	* configure.ac: Increment version number to 1.9.6 to reflect the
	  libpcap API change.

	* Updated ieee-oui.txt and ieee-iab.txt files.

2019-08-29 Roy Hills <royhills@hotmail.com>

	* arp-scan.c: include the interface MAC address in the interface
	  summary output.  E.g.

          Interface: ens33, datalink type: EN10MB (Ethernet), MAC Addr: 00:0c:29:01:0d:21

	* Updated ieee-oui.txt and ieee-iab.txt files.

2019-03-16 Roy Hills <royhills@hotmail.com>

	* acinclude.m4: Use AC_TRY_LINK instead of AC_TRY_COMPILE when
	  determining if tack protector support is supported, as some
	  operating system may lack the libssp library.  Thanks to
	  ffontaine for this pull request.

	* Updated ieee-oui.txt and ieee-iab.txt files.

2017-07-19 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* Print "locally administered" for qualifing OUIs.  Thanks to sanderjo
	  for this pull request.

2017-05-29 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* Updated ieee-oui.txt and ieee-iab.txt files.

2016-09-03 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* arp-scan.c: Use the new libpcap 1.0 API functions pcap_create(),
	  pcap_set_XXX(), pcap_activate() instead of the old pcap_open_live().
	  This requires libpcap 1.0 or later, so this and future versions of
	  arp-scan will not work with libpcap 0.9 or earlier.

	* configure.ac: Change pcap compatibility test to check for pcap_create
	  instead of pcap_sendpacket to test for libpcap 1.0 or later.

	* configure.ac: Increment version number to 1.9.5 to reflect the
	  libpcap API change.

	* Modified copyright statement in files to include up to 2016.

2016-08-31 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* arp-scan.c, arp-scan.h: Merge changes by tissieres to use
	  source_mac rather than interface_mac in the pcap filter. This
	  requires us to enable promiscuous mode to ensure that the
	  ARP replies are received.

	* configure.ac: Increment version number to 1.9.4 to reflect the
	  changes made since 2016-08-13.

2016-08-30 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* arp-fingerprint: Merge changes by Rhig to add "-l" option.

	* arp-fingerprint: Added patterns for FreeBSD 10.3, DragonflyBSD 4.6,
	  Windows10, Linux 4.0, Linux 4.6, OpenBSD 5.9, NetBSD 7.0.

2016-08-22 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* configure.ac: Remove function replacement for inet_aton, as all
	  systems I'm aware of have this function now.  This replacement
	  was needed for Solaris 8, but Solaris 10 does not need it and I
	  doubt that anyone is still using versions of Solaris prior to 10.

	* inet_aton.c: Removed.

2016-08-20 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* arp-scan.c, arp-scan.h: Use posix hash table functions hcreate(),
	  hsearch() and hdestroy() instead of the gas hash table code.

	* hash.c, hash.h, obstack.c, obstack.h: Removed.

2016-08-13 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* get-oui, get-oui.1, arp-scan.1: Update IEEE OUI download location.

	* ieee-oui.txt: Updated from IEEE website using modified script.

	* check-decode: Updated manufacturer names to match updated OUI file.

	* configure.ac: Increased version number from 1.9.2 to 1.9.3 to
	  reflect the various changes made on github between Aug 2013 and
	  Aug 2016.

	* acinclude.m4: Assume long long int format is %lld if cross compiling.

	* arp-scan.c: Correct warning message for invalid IP addresses to avoid
	  segmentation violation.

2015-11-13 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* get-iab: Read the OUI from the data in the file instead of using
	  the constant 24-bit number 0050C2.  This is required because the
	  0050C2 IEEE OUI has been fully used, and allocations have started
	  from the 40D855 IEEE OUI.

	* *.c: Removed unneeded trailing whitespace in source code.  Thanks
	  to "jubalh" for this pull request.

	* arp-scan.c, check-run1: Change --help and --version options to output
	  to stdout (fd 0) instead of stderr (fd 1) in accordance with GNU
	  Coding Standards section 4.7, "Standards for Command Line Interfaces".
	  Thanks to "srdja" for this pull request.

	* get-oui, get-iab: omit trailing whitespace from ieee-oui.txt and
	  ieee-iab.txt files.

	* ieee-oui.txt, ieee-iab.txt: Updated from IEEE website using modified
	  scripts.

2013-12-02 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* link-packet-socket.c: Die with an error if we can't open a raw
	  packet socket to obtain the interface MAC address.  This avoids
	  a segmentation violation on Linux if we try to run arp-scan against
	  a specific interface without the required privileges.

2013-12-02 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* arp-scan.c, arp-scan.h arp-scan.1: Added new --randomseed option,
	  which allows the random numer generator to be seeded with a specific
	  value.

	* arp-scan.c, arp-scan.h, utils.c: Removed --debug (-d) option. This
	  has not been used for years, and the associated debug code was
	  causing more clutter than it was worth.

	* check-host-list: Added test to check generation of random host list.

2013-12-01 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* configure.ac, .gitignore: Added configure option --enable-gcov to
	  enable gcov code coverage.

2013-11-12 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* arp-fingerprint: Added fingerprint for Cisco IOS 15.0.

2013-11-02 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* arp-scan.c, arp-scan.1: Added new --plain (-x) option to supress
	  printing of header and footer text, and only display one output
	  line for each responding host. Idea from Stefan Tomanek's arp-scan
	  fork on github at https://github.com/wertarbyte/arp-scan.

2013-09-21 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* get-oui, get-iab: Use LWP::UserAgent instead of LWP::Simple to enable
	  us to obtain the raw content rather than the decoded content. This
	  avoids Unicode/UTF-8 issues caused by a change in behaviour between
	  LWP 5.813 on Debian Lenny and 5.836 on Debian Squeeze.

	* ieee-oui.txt, ieee-iab.txt: Updated from IEEE website using modified
	  scripts.

2013-09-05 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* arp-fingerprint: Added fingerprint for WIZnet W5100 on Arduino
	  Ethernet shield.

2013-09-05 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* configure.ac: Change the bug-report string in AC_INIT from the
	  arp-scan email address to the github URL.

	* Added references to the github repository in various files in
	  place of the arp-scan email address.

	* Updated ieee-oui.txt and ieee-iab.txt files.

2013-08-15 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* Removed $Id$ keywords from all files, and associated rcsid variables
	  from C source. These are not really needed and they don't work with
	  git.

	* check-run1: Added GPL licence text, which had been accidentally
	  ommitted when the script was written.

	* configure.ac: Incremented version to 1.9.2 to distinguish new
	  version under git revision control.

	* .gitignore: new file containing file patterns that should not be
	  committed to the repository.

2013-08-15 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* ChangeLog: Removed pointless id keywords.

	* Final SVN revision before migration to git.

2013-07-25 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* Released arp-scan version 1.9.
	  tarball arp-scan-1.9.tar.gz, size 488442 bytes
	  md5sum 38584d6c1edfa9f6b41d496e4a5539f1

	* configure.ac: Incremented version to 1.9.1.

2013-07-24 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* ieee-oui.txt, ieee-iab.txt: Updated IEEE OUI and IAB listings from
	  IEEE website using get-oui and get-iab Perl scripts.

	* configure.ac: Incremented version number to 1.9.

	* NEWS: Updated with latest changes.

2013-05-09 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* ieee-oui.txt, ieee-iab.txt: Updated IEEE OUI and IAB listings from
	  IEEE website using get-oui and get-iab Perl scripts.

	* Built with autoconf 2.69 and automake 1.11 from Debian Wheezy to
	  add support for ARM 64 bit CPU architecture and remove configure
	  warnings about conftest.dSYM on MacOS X.

2013-05-03 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* arp-fingerprint: Added FreeBSD 8.2, FreeBSD 9.1, DragonflyBSD 3.0,
	  DragonflyBSD 3.2, Linux 3.2, Linux 3.8, NetBSD 5.1, NetBSD 6.0,
	  OpenBSD 4.8, OpenBSD 5.1 and RiscOS 5.19.

	* NEWS: Updated with changes since last release.

	* configure.ac: Incremented version number to 1.8.4.

2013-04-25 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* arp-scan.c, arp-scan.h: Changed arp-scan to use the libpcap
	  function pcap_sendpacket() instead of our own link-layer specific
	  link_send() functions. This means that we now require libpcap
	  version 0.9.3 or later.

	* link-bpf.c, link-dlpi.c, link-packet-socket.c: Removed unneeded
	  link-layer specific link_send() functions. Changed link_open()
	  and link_close() functions to static, and modified
	  get_hardware_address() and get_source_ip() functions to call
	  link_open/link_close directly. Included link_t typedef in
	  link_handle struct declaration.

	* configure.ac: Change the libpcap function check from
	  pcap_lib_version() to pcap_sendpacket(), to ensure that we have
	  a recent enough version of libpcap.

	* arp-scan.c: New function get_source_ip() to get the interface IP
	  address using platform-independent code.

	* link-bpf.c, link-dlpi.c, link-packet-socket.c: Removed unneeded
	  link-layer specific get_source_ip() functions.

2013-04-15 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* Modified copyright statement in files to include up to 2013.

	* get-oui, get-iab: Modified regex to allow optional whitespace at
	  the beginning of line.

	* ieee-oui.txt, ieee-iab.txt: Updated IEEE OUI and IAB listings from
	  IEEE website using get-oui and get-iab Perl scripts.

	* check-decode: Updated for new IEEE OUI vendors.

	* configure.ac: Incremented version number to 1.8.3.

	* arp-scan.c: Removed unneeded errlen declaration to avoid "set but
	  not used" warning with GCC 4.6 and later.

2013-01-01 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* arp-fingerprint: Added Windows 8

2012-08-08 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* configure.ac: Added OS pattern for Dragonfly BSD.

2012-06-06 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* arp-fingerprint: Added fingerprint for BeOS.

2012-05-29 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* arp-scan.c: Copy the pcap_header->ts structure to a temporary
	  struct timeval before passing to timeval_diff during rtt calculation.
	  We can't pass a pointer to pcap_header->ts directly to timeval_diff
	  because it's not guaranteed to have the same size as a struct
	  timeval. E.g. OpenBSD 5.1 on amd64. Thanks to Stuart Henderson at
	  OpenBSD for spotting this bug.

2012-05-20 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* get-oui, get-iab: Applied patch from Stuart Henderson at OpenBSD.
	  This allows the -u (alternative URL) option to be correctly handled,
	  and changes the default URLs to the new locations on the IEEE
	  website (the old locations still work, but with a redirect).

	* ieee-oui.txt, ieee-iab.txt: Updated IEEE OUI and IAB listings from
	  IEEE website using get-oui and get-iab Perl scripts.

2011-12-30 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* arp-scan.c, arp-scan.h, arp-scan.1: If the location of the various
	  MAC/Vendor mapping files (IEEE OUI, IEEE IAB or custom) are not
	  specified on the command line with the appropriate option, then
	  look for them in the current directory before looking in the system
	  wide location.

	* ieee-oui.txt, ieee-iab.txt: Updated IEEE OUI and IAB listings from
	  IEEE website using get-oui and get-iab Perl scripts.

	* check-decode: Updated patterns to reflect vendor name changes in
	  latest IEEE OUI file.

2011-12-18 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* configure.ac: Incremented version to 1.8.2

2011-09-27 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* arp-scan.h, arp-scan.c, arp-scan.1: Added new option --rtt (-D) to
          calculate and display the packet round-trip time.

2011-08-18 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* arp-scan.h, arp-scan.1: Raised default timeout from 100ms to 500ms.
	  It is suspected that the default timeout is too short in some
	  situations, and this may be one of the causes of duplicate responses.

	* arp-scan.h, link-bpf.c: Include <net/bpf.h> before arp-scan.h in
	  link-bpf.c, and remove conditional inclusion of <net/bpf.h> in
	  arp-scan.h. This causes <net/bpf.h> to be included before <pcap.h>
	  on all systems that use BPF, e.g. BSD and MacOS. This should prevent
	  the problems that occur on some of these systems, and remove the need
	  for conditional inclusion to prevent them.

	* arp-fingerprint: Added additional fingerprint for Linux 2.6 on
	  Amazon Kindle.

2011-07-31 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* arp-fingerprint: Added fingerprint for GNU/Hurd

2011-07-04 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* Makefile.am: Added pkt-custom-request-vlan-llc.dat to EXTRA_DIST.

2011-03-07 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* configure.ac: Incremented version to 1.8.1.

2011-03-01 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* Released arp-scan version 1.8.
	  tarball arp-scan-1.8.tar.gz, size 430221 bytes
	  md5sum be8826574ec566217eb7ca040fe472f9

	* configure.ac: Remove version number from AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE macro,
	  as this usage is obsolete now. Incremented version to 1.8.

	* ieee-oui.txt, ieee-iab.txt: Updated IEEE OUI and IAB listings from
	  IEEE website using get-oui and get-iab Perl scripts.

2011-02-26 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* pkt-custom-request-vlan-llc.dat: New data file for check-packet
	  script containing custom ARP request with 802.1Q VLAN tag and
	  LLC/SNAP framing.

	* check-packet: Added check for custom ARP request with 802.1Q VLAN
	  tag and LLC/SNAP framing.

2011-02-25 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* pkt-vlan-llc-response.pcap: New file containing an example of
	  an ARP reply with 802.1Q tag and LLC/SNAP framing. From a Cisco
	  2621 router.

	* pkt-trailer-response.pcap: Renamed from pkt-trailer-reply.pcap.

	* check-decode: New checks for trailer response and 802.1Q/LLC
	  responses.

	* arp-scan.c: Modified pcap filter string to capture ARP responses
	  with both 802.1Q tag and LLC/SNAP framing.

	* Makefile.am: Include pkt-trailer-response.pcap and
	  pkt-vlan-llc-response.pcap.

2011-02-21 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* arp-scan.c: Modified usage() so that it can output either brief or
          detailed help output depending on a new "detailed" argument.  Now,
          detailed output, including information on the available options, is
          only displayed when arp-scan is run with the --help option.  For
          error conditions such as incorrect options, it only produces brief
          output.

	* arp-scan.c: Modify display_packet() to report responses where the
	  ARP protocol type (ar$pro) is not IP (0x0800). This allows trailer
	  negotiation responses to be distinguished from regular ARP replies.

	* pkt-trailer-reply.pcap: New file containing an example of a trailer
	  negotiation ARP response from a Quasijarus 4.3BSD system on SIMH VAX.

	* arp-fingerprint: Added fingerprint for Blackberry OS.

2011-02-19 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* arp-scan.h: On Apple Mac OS X systems with Xcode 2.5 and later,
	  include <net/bpf.h> before <pcap.h>.

	* configure.ac: Increment version number to 1.7.6.

2011-02-06 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* acinclude.m4: Changed GCC_FORTIFY_SOURCE macro so the test program
	  doesn't include <features.h>, because that header file is not
	  present on all the operating systems that we support, e.g. OpenBSD.

2011-02-04 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* arp-scan.c: Use pcap_get_selectable_fd() rather than pcap_fileno()
	  to get the pcap file descriptor.

	* check-host-list: Added new test to check the creation of the host
	  list.

2011-02-03 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* arp-scan.c: When using --writepkttofile we no longer open a link
	  layer socket or a pcap handle, so we don't need root privileges.

	* check-packet: Remove check for root privileges as this is no longer
	  needed.

	* check-decode: Added two new tests to improve code coverage.

	* arp-scan.c, arp-scan.h: Modify add_host_pattern() and add_host() so
	  we always use the more efficient inet_pton() rather than
	  get_host_address() for IPnet/bits, IPnet:mask and IPstart-IPend
	  patterns.

2011-02-02 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* arp-scan.c: Change operation of --readpktfromfile so it reads from
	  a pcap savefile rather than from a raw file.

	* pkt-simple-response.pcap, pkt-padding-response.pcap,
	  pkt-vlan-response.pcap, pkt-llc-response.pcap: New pcap format
	  files for check-decode.

	* check-decode: Modified to use new pcap format savefiles, and remove
	  check for root privileges as this is no longer needed.

2011-01-31 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* link-dlpi.c: Fix "comparison between signed and unsigned" warning in
	  function dlpi_msg.

	* arp-fingerprint: Added fingerprint for Windows 7.

	* arp-scan.c: Changed what gets displayed for the different verbose
	  levels, and updated the --help output to reflect the new behaviour.

2011-01-30 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* check-packet, check-decode: New checks to check packet creation and
	  packet decoding.

	* pkt-custom-request.dat, pkt-custom-request-llc.dat,
	  pkt-custom-request-padding.dat, pkt-custom-request-vlan.dat,
	  pkt-padding-response.dat, pkt-simple-request.dat,
	  pkt-simple-response.dat: Data files for check-packet and check-decode
	  scripts.

	* Makefile.am: Add new check scripts and data files.

	* arp-scan.c, arp-scan.h: Added undocumented options --writepkttofile
	  and --readpktfromfile to allow data to be written to or read from a
	  file instead of the network for testing.

	* arp-scan.c: Use "stdin" instead of fdopen(0,"r") when using
	  --filename=-, fixing a bug which was causing fd 0 to be closed.
	  Set the frame type correctly for LLC/SNAP format frames: before
	  it was always set to 0x0806.

	* configure.ac: Add headers required for --writepkttofile and
	  --readpktfromfile.  Increment version number to 1.7.5.

2011-01-09 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* COPYING: Changed license from GPLv2 to GPLv3.

	* Modified licence statement in source files to specify GPLv3

	* Modified copyright statement in files to include up to 2011.

2010-12-22 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* arp-scan.c: Change req_interval back from unsigned to int. This
	  addresses a bug in the timing code that was introduced in svn
	  r18043, which caused the packet rate to be very high irrespective
	  of the specified interval.

	* configure.ac: Enable -Wextra warnings for gcc. Increment version
	  number to 1.7.4.

2010-12-22 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* hash.c, hash.h, obstack.c, obstack.h: Updated version of GAS hash
	  table code to the latest version from GNU binutils 2.21.  This new
	  version addresses the shadowed variable warnings that the old version
	  used to produce when compiled with -Wshadow.

	* configure.ac: define ATTRIBUTE_UNUSED macro to enable portable use
	  of attribute unused to mark possibly unused function arguments.

	* arp-scan.c: Minor changes to remove a couple of shadowed variable
	  warnings.

2010-12-07 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* acinclude.m4: Added GCC_WEXTRA macro to determine if the C compiler
	  supports the -Wextra switch to enable extra warnings.

	* arp-scan.c, arp-scan.h, utils.c: Remove unused function parameters
	  and address signed/unsigned comparisons highlighted by -Wextra.

2010-12-03 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* arp-scan.1: Added warning about setting ar$spa to the destination
	  IP address. Suggested by Ed Schaller.

2010-04-25 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* arp-fingerprint: Added 2.11BSD

2009-08-15 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* arp-scan.c, utils.c: Improve handling of --bandwidth and
	  --interval options: Allow either upper or lowercase
	  multiplier letters and give an error if an unknown multiplier
	  character is used.  Previously an unknown multiplier character
	  or one with the wrong case was silently ignored and treated as
	  no multiplier at all.

	* wrappers.c: Change Strtoul and Strtol so they give an error
	  if the underlying function finishes at an unconvertible
	  character other than NULL or whitespace.

	* configure.ac: Added extra warning "-Wwrite-strings" for gcc.

2009-08-14 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* arp-scan.c, arp-scan.h, configure.ac, error.c: Removed syslog
	  functionality as this is not used and has been #ifdef'ed out
	  for some time.

2009-05-06 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* autoconf.ac: Updated to autoconf 2.61

2009-03-06 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* acinclude.m4: Added macros to detect compiler support for
	  -fstack-protect, -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE and -Wformat-security.

	* configure.ac: Conditionally enable compiler flags for
	  -fstack-protect, -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE and -Wformat-security using
	  the new acinclude.m4 autoconf macros.

	* configure.ac: Incremented version to 1.7.2.

2008-08-01 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* arp-fingerprint get-iab get-oui: Replaced "#!/usr/bin/perl" shebang
	  with "#!/usr/bin/env perl" to increase portability.  This allows
	  these perl scripts to work on systems where perl is not installed in
	  /usr/bin, such as NetBSD.

2008-07-26 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* configure.ac: Incremented version to 1.7.1.

	* arp-fingerprint: Added NetBSD 4.0, FreeBSD 7.0 and Vista SP1

2008-07-25 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* Released arp-scan version 1.7.
	  tarball arp-scan-1.7.tar.gz, size 344,771 bytes
	  md5sum a9927dba2b1dbdfd1c3b3bb09615fc14

2008-07-24 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* ieee-oui.txt, ieee-iab.txt: Updated IEEE OUI and IAB listings from
	  IEEE website using get-oui and get-iab Perl scripts.

	* configure.ac: Incremented version to 1.7.

2008-07-11 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* arp-scan.a: Removed reference to RMIF environment variable.
	  arp-scan now uses the value specified with --interface, or
	  if that is not specified, picks an interface with
	  pcap_lookupdev().

	* configure.ac: Incremented version to 1.6.4 for pre-release
	  testing.

	* *.c, *.h: Modified copyright statements to read 2005-2008.

2008-05-03 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* arp-scan.c: Added --pcapsavefile (-W) option to allow received
	  ARP responses to be saved in the specified pcap savefile for
	  later analysis.

	* TODO: Removed plan to support libpcap 0.7 as just about every
	  system has at least libpcap 0.8, and most have 0.9.

	* arp-scan.c: changed display_packet() so it displays the source
	  address from the frame header in parens if it is different from the
	  ar$sha address.  E.g.
          192.168.1.255 ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff (00:03:a0:88:eb:a8)   Broadcast

2007-12-10 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* arp-scan.c: Change most calls to strtol() to use the new
          wrapper function Strtol() instead, because this checks for
          errors.  Previously, a non-numeric value would be converted to
          zero without any error, meaning something like "--snap=xxx"
          would be silently accepted.  Now such invalid inputs results in
          an error.

	* arp-scan.c: Added new --vlan (-Q) option to support sending
	  ARP packets with an 802.1Q VLAN tag.  Response packets with
	  an 802.1Q tag are decoded and displayed irrespective of this
	  option.

2007-04-17 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* arp-scan.h: Reduced MAX_FRAME from 65536 to 2048 bytes.

	* arp-scan.c: Add the optional padding in marshal_arp_pkt(), and
	  avoid potential buffer overflow if padding is longer than the
	  remaining buffer size.

	* arp-scan.c: Changed display_packet() to take ARP structure, extra
	  data and framing type as parameters passed from callback() to avoid
	  having to call unmarshal_arp_pkt() twice.  This also means that
	  we don't need to pass the raw frame to display_packet() now as it
	  has the data in individual variables.

	* arp-scan.c: Move padding addition to marshal_arp_pkt().

2007-04-14 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* arp-scan.h, arp-scan.c: Changed MAXIP to MAX_FRAME and changed value
	  to 65536 bytes.  This is the maximum allowable frame size, which is
	  used to size read/write buffers.  This is much larger than any
	  layer-2 frame.

	* arp-scan.h: Changed PACKET_OVERHEAD to 18 (6+6+2 ... +4) and
	  MINIMUM_FRAME_SIZE to 46.

	* arp-scan.h: undefine SYSLOG, as we don't use this any more, and I
	  doubt that anyone else needs it.  The syslog functionality may be
	  removed in a future release.

2007-04-13 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* arp-scan.c: Added support for RFC 1042 LLC/SNAP framing with the
	  new --llc (-L) option.

2007-04-12 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* Released arp-scan version 1.6.
	  tarball arp-scan-1.6.tar.gz, size 319,566 bytes
	  md5sum eb24303c6eb4d77c3abf23511efce642

2007-04-10 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* mt19937ar.c: New file - Mersenne Twister random number generator.

	* arp-scan.c: Changed random number implementation to use the mersenne
	  twister functions from mt19937ar.c rather than random() from the C
	  library.  This improves portability, as random() is not part of
	  standard C.

	* Updated ieee-oui.txt and ieee-iab.txt from the IEEE website
	  using get-oui and get-iab Perl scripts.

2007-04-08 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* utils.c: Removed ununsed function printable().

	* arp-scan.c: Added /* NOTREACHED */ comments in appropriate places.
	  Removed unneeded max_iter global variable.
	  Added call to pcap_lib_version() in arp_scan_version().

	* configure.ac: Changed check for pcap_datalink_val_to_name() to
	  check for pcap_lib_version() instead.

2007-04-06 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* configure.ac: Added checks for strlcat and strlcpy, with
	  replacement functions using the OpenBSD implementations if they are
	  not present.

	* strlcat.c, strlcpy.c: New source files from the OpenBSD source at
	  http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/lib/libc/string

	* *.c: replaced most calls to strcat and strncat with strlcat, and
	  calls to strcpy and strncpy with strlcpy.  Two calls to strncpy
	  remain because the source strings are not null terminated.

2007-04-05 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* arp-scan.c: Check the return status of pcap_dispatch() against -1
	  rather than < 0 to check for error because the use of pcap_breakloop
	  results in a return status of -2, and this is not an error.  Even
	  though we don't use pcap_breakloop, we should still behave correctly
	  if it used in the future.

	* arp-scan.c: Check return status of inet_pton() separately against
          < 0, which indicates and error, and against == 0, which indicates
	  that the string is not a valid address.  Previously we handled these
	  together with the comparison <= 0.  Also return from add_host()
	  immediately if the host lookup fails.

2007-04-04 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* arp-fingerprint: Check that the target host specification is not
	  an IP network or range, and terminate with an error message if it
	  is.  Some users have mistakenly tried to use arp-fingerprint against
	  a network, and I want to give a better error message in these cases.

	* arp-fingerprint: Remove the default "-N" from the arp-scan command
	  line as it is valid to use a hostname.  Modified the associated
	  manpage so it agrees with this change.

2007-04-03 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* arp-scan.c: Add ioctl to reduce the bufmod timeout to zero for
	  Solaris (DLPI).  This prevents buffering, and ensures that packets
	  are available immediately.  This allows arp-scan to work on
	  Solaris (tested on Solaris/SPARC 2.9 with Libpcap 0.9.5).

2007-03-29 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* arp-scan.c: Change help output, so we display the default value for
	  the --bandwidth option, and don't display it for the --interval
	  option (as the latter will always be zero because we use bandwidth
	  by default).  Updated arp-scan.1 manpage with the new output.

2007-02-15 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* link-dlpi.c: Wrote link-level functions for DLPI.  Compiles on
	  Solaris 9, but not fully tested.

2007-01-26 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* Updated ieee-oui.txt and ieee-iab.txt from the IEEE website
	  using get-oui and get-iab Perl scripts.

2006-07-26 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* Released version 1.5.

	  Tarball details:

	  -rw-rw-r--  1 rsh nta 298917 2006-07-26 13:50 arp-scan-1.5.tar.gz
	  85b0e04323ce3a423f60ab905a589856  arp-scan-1.5.tar.gz

	* configure.ac: Incremented version number to 1.5.1 in preparation
	  for post-1.5 changes.

2006-07-24 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* ieee-oui.txt, ieee-iab.txt: Updated IEEE OUI and IAB listings from
	  IEEE website using get-oui and get-iab Perl scripts.

2006-07-22 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* configure.ac: Increased version number to 1.4.5.

	* README: Added installation instructions.

2006-07-21 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* link-bpf.c: New file containing link-level sending functions
	  for BPF as used by BSD OSes.

	* link-packet-socket.c: Changed socket protocol from SOCK_DGRAM to
	  SOCK_RAW, so the entire Ethernet frame including the header can
          be controlled.

	* arp-scan.c: Changed to build entire outgoing frame, rather than
	  just the ARP payload.

	* arp-scan.c: Modifications to support BPF link-layer.  This has been
	  tested on FreeBSD 6.1, OpenBSD 3.9, NetBSD 3.0.1 and
          Darwin 7.9.0 (MacOS 10.3.9).

	* arp-scan.c: Changed operation of the --srcaddr option.  Now it
	  sets the hardware address in the frame header of outgoing packets
	  without altering the address of the outgoing interface.

	* link-packet-socket.c, link-bpf.c: Removed set_hardware_address()
	  function, as this is no longer needed with the new operation of
	  the --srcaddr option.

	* arp-scan.c: Removed unneeded gettimeofday() call in add_host().
	  This increases the host addition rate considerably, so adding
	  a class-A network (2^24 hosts) now takes 15 seconds as opposed
	  to 80 seconds.

	* arp-scan.h, arp-scan.c: Removed unneeded element "n" from host
	  entry structure.  This reduces the per-host memory usage from
	  32 bytes per host to 28 bytes per host.

	* mac-vendor.5: New manual page for the mac-vendor.txt file format.

2006-07-03 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* link-packet-socket.c: New file containing all functions that
	  use Linux packet socket link layer interface.  This moves all
	  the packet-socket implementation dependent to this one file, which
	  should make future porting to other operating systems easier.

	* arp-scan.c, arp-scan.h: Modified to use link-layer functions in
	  new link-packet-socket.c file.

	* configure.ac: Increased version number to 1.4.2.

2006-06-28 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* arp-scan.c, arp-scan.h: removed the unneeded ip_address union
	  and replaced it with "struct in_addr".  As arp-scan is only
	  applicable to IPv4, we don't need to use the union.  This
	  change reduces the size of an address from 16 bytes to 4, and
	  reduces the per-host memory usage from 44 bytes/host to 32.

	* arp-fingerprint: Added Windows Vista Beta 2 fingerprint.

2006-06-27 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* configure.ac: Increase version number to 1.4.1 in preparation
	  for future changes.

2006-06-26 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* Released version 1.4.
	  This is the first stable version.  v1.3 was a beta, and v1.0,
	  1.1 and 1.2 were internal versions before it was released under GPL.
