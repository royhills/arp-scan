# mac-vendor.txt -- Ethernet vendor file for arp-scan
#
# This file contains Ethernet vendor mappings for arp-scan.  These are used
# to determine the vendor for a give Ethernet interface given the MAC address.
#
# Each line of this file contains a MAC-vendor mapping in the form:
#
# <MAC-Prefix><TAB><Vendor>
#
# Where <MAC-Prefix> is the prefix of the MAC address in hex, and <Vendor>
# is the name of the vendor.  The prefix can be of any length from two hex
# digits (one octet) to twelve hex digits (six octets, the entire Ethernet
# hardware address).
#
# For example:
#
# 012345	would match 01:23:45:xx:xx:xx, where xx represents any value;
# 0123456	would match 01:23:45:6x:xx:xx; and
# 01234567	would match 01:23:45:67:xx:xx.
#
# Do not include entries from the IEEE OUI or IAB listings, as these are
# already in the files ieee-oui.txt and ieee-iab.txt, which are automatically
# used by arp-scan.  See get-oui(1) and get-iab(1) for details of how to
# update the OUI and IAB listings.  This file is for MAC addresses that are
# not present in the IEEE listings.
#
# The alphabetic hex characters [A-F] must be entered in upper case.
#
# The order of entries in this file are not important.
#
# arp-scan will attempt to match larger prefixes before trying to match
# smaller ones, and will stop at the first match.
#
# Blank lines and lines beginning with "#" are ignored.
