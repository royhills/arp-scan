# mac-vendor.txt -- Ethernet vendor file for arp-scan
#
# This file contains Ethernet vendor mappings for arp-scan.  These are used
# to determine the vendor for a give Ethernet interface given the MAC address.
#
# Each line of this file contains a MAC-vendor mapping in the form:
#
# <MAC-Prefix><TAB><Vendor>
#
# Where <MAC-Prefix> is the prefix of the MAC address in hex, and <Vendor>
# is the name of the vendor.  The prefix can be of any length from two hex
# digits (one octet) to twelve hex digits (six octets, the entire Ethernet
# hardware address).
#
# Alphabetic hex characters [A-F] may use either upper or lower case, and
# seperator symbols such as ":", "-" and "." are ignored. This permits the
# use of standard format MAC addresses in this file.
#
# For example:
#
# 01:23:45	matches 01:23:45:xx:xx:xx, where xx represents any value;
# 01:23:45:6	matches 01:23:45:6x:xx:xx; and
# 01:23:45:67	matches 01:23:45:67:xx:xx.
#
# Do not include entries from the IEEE OUI listings, as these are already in
# the file ieee-oui.txt, which is automatically used by arp-scan.  See
# get-oui(1) for details of how to update the OUI listings.
#
# The order of entries in this file are not important.
#
# arp-scan will attempt to match larger prefixes before trying to match
# smaller ones, and will stop at the first match.
#
# Blank lines and lines beginning with "#" are ignored.

# You can add local MAC address/name mappings to this file. There should be
