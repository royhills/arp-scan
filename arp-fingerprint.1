.SH NAME
arp-fingerprint \- Fingerprint a system using ARP
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B arp-fingerprint
.RI [ options ]
.I target
.PP
The target should be specified as a single IP address or hostname.  You cannot specify multiple targets, IP networks or ranges.
.PP
If you use an IP address for the target, you can use the
.B -o
option to pass the
.B --numeric
option to
.BR arp-scan ,
which will prevent it from attempting DNS lookups.  This can speed up the
fingerprinting process, especially on systems with a slow or faulty DNS
configuration.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B arp-fingerprint
fingerprints the specified target host using the ARP protocol.
.PP
It sends various different types of ARP request to the target, and records
which types it responds to. From this, it constructs a fingerprint string
consisting of "1" where the target responded and "0" where it did not.
An example of a fingerprint string is
.IR 01000100000 .
This fingerprint string is then used to lookup the likely target operating system.
.PP
Many of the fingerprint strings are shared by several operating systems, so
there is not always a one-to-one mapping between fingerprint strings and
operating systems. Also the fact that a system's fingerprint matches a certain
operating system (or list of operating systems) does not necessarily mean that
the system being fingerprinted is that operating system, although it is quite
likely. This is because the list of operating systems is not exhaustive; it is
just what I have discovered to date, and there are bound to be operating
systems that are not listed.
.PP
The ARP fingerprint of a system is generally a function of that system's
kernel (although it is possible for the ARP function to be implemented in
user space, it almost never is).
.PP
Sometimes, an operating system can give different fingerprints depending
on the configuration.  An example is Linux, which will respond to a non-local
source IP address if that IP is routed through the interface being tested.
This is both good and bad: on one hand it makes the fingerprinting task more
complex; but on the other, it can allow some aspects of the system configuration
to be determined.
.PP
Sometimes the fact that two different operating systems share a common ARP
fingerprint string points to a re-use of networking code. One example of
this is Windows NT and FreeBSD.
.PP
.B arp-fingerprint
uses
.B arp-scan
to send the ARP requests and receive the replies.
.PP
There are other methods that can be used to fingerprint a system using
.B arp-scan
which can be used in addition to
.BR arp-fingerprint .
These additional methods are not included in
.B arp-fingerprint
either because they are likely to cause disruption to the target system, or
because they require knowledge of the target's configuration that may not
always be available.
.PP
Most of the ARP requests that \fBarp-fingerprint\fP sends are non-standard,
so it could disrupt systems that don't have a robust TCP/IP stack.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -h
Display a brief usage message and exit.
.TP
.B -v
Display verbose progress messages.
.TP
.B -o <option-string>
Pass specified options to arp-scan. You need to enclose the options
string in quotes if it contains spaces. e.g.
-o "-I eth1".  The commonly used options are --interface (-I) and --numeric
(-N).
.TP
.B -l
Fingerprint all hosts on the local network. You do not need to specify any
target hosts if this option is given.
.TP
.B -m
Include the MAC address of the target in the output.
.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
$ arp-fingerprint 192.168.0.1
192.168.0.1   01000100000     Linux 2.2, 2.4, 2.6
.fi
.PP
.nf
$ arp-fingerprint -o "-N -I eth1" 192.168.0.202
192.168.0.202 11110100000     FreeBSD 5.3, Win98, WinME, NT4, 2000, XP, 2003
.fi
.SH NOTES
.B arp-fingerprint
is implemented in Perl, so you need to have the Perl interpreter installed on
your system to use it.
