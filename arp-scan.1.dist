.SH NAME
arp-scan \- The ARP scanner
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B arp-scan
.RI [ options ] " " [ hosts ...]
.PP
Target hosts must be specified on the command line unless the
.B --file
option is given, in which case the targets are read from the specified file
instead, or the
.B --localnet
option is used, in which case the targets are generated from the network
interface IP address and netmask.
.PP
The target hosts can be specified as IP addresses or hostnames.  You can also
specify the target as
.B IPnetwork/bits
(e.g. 192.168.1.0/24) to specify all
hosts in the given network (network and broadcast addresses included),
.B IPstart-IPend
(e.g. 192.168.1.3-192.168.1.27) to specify all hosts in the
inclusive range, or
.B IPnetwork:NetMask
(e.g. 192.168.1.0:255.255.255.0) to specify all hosts in the given network
and mask.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B arp-scan
sends ARP packets to hosts on the local network and displays any responses
that are received. The network interface to use can be specified with the
.B --interface
option. If this option is not present,
.B arp-scan
will search the system interface list for the lowest numbered, configured up
interface (excluding loopback).  By default, the ARP packets are sent to the
Ethernet broadcast address, \fIff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\fP, but that can be changed with the
.B --destaddr
option.
.PP
.B arp-scan
needs privileges to send and receive raw packets. It can be run as root or be
installed SUID root on any system, but other options are available depending
on the operating system:
.TP
Linux with POSIX.1e capabilities support using libcap:
.B arp-scan
is capabilities aware and requires CAP_NET_RAW in the permitted set.
It will automatically enable CAP_NET_RAW to open the network socket and drop
the capability immediately after the open. You can use
.I setcap cap_net_raw+p /path/to/arp-scan
to add CAP_NET_RAW to the permitted set of the arp-scan executable.
.TP
BSD and MacOS:
You need read/write access to
.I /dev/bpf*
.PP
The target hosts to scan may be specified in one of three ways: by specifying
the targets on the command line; by specifying a file containing the targets
with the
.B --file
option; or by specifying the
.B --localnet
option which causes all possible hosts on the network attached to the interface
(as defined by the interface address and mask) to be scanned. For hosts specified
on the command line, or with the
.B --file
option, you can use either IP addresses or hostnames.  You can also use network
specifications
.BR IPnetwork/bits ,
.BR IPstart-IPend ,
or
.BR IPnetwork:NetMask .
.PP
The list of target hosts is stored in memory.  Each host in this list uses 28
bytes of memory, so scanning a Class-B network (65,536 hosts) requires about
1.75MB of memory for the list, and scanning a Class-A (16,777,216 hosts)
requires about 448MB.
.PP
.B arp-scan
supports Ethernet and 802.11 wireless networks. It could also
support token ring and FDDI, but they have not been tested. It does
not support serial links such as PPP or SLIP, because ARP is not supported
on them.
.PP
The ARP protocol is a layer-2 (datalink layer) protocol that is used to
determine a host's layer-2 address given its layer-3 (network
layer) address. ARP was designed to work with any layer-2 and
layer-3 address format, but the most common use is to map IP addresses to
Ethernet hardware addresses, and this is what
.B arp-scan
supports. ARP only operates on
the local network, and cannot be routed. Although the ARP protocol makes use
of IP addresses, it is not an IP-based protocol and
.B arp-scan
can be used on an interface that is not configured for IP.
.PP
ARP is only used by IPv4 hosts. IPv6 uses NDP (neighbour discovery protocol)
instead, which is a different protocol and is not supported by
.BR arp-scan .
.PP
One ARP packet is sent for each for each target host, with the target protocol
address (the \fIar$tpa\fP field) set to the IP address of this host. If a host does not
respond, then the ARP packet will be re-sent once more.  The maximum
number of retries can be changed with the
.B --retry
option.  Reducing the number of retries will reduce the scanning time at
the possible risk of missing some results due to packet loss.
.PP
You can specify the bandwidth that
.B arp-scan
will use for the outgoing ARP
packets with the
.B --bandwidth
option.  By default, it uses a bandwidth of 256000 bits per second. Increasing
the bandwidth will reduce the scanning time, but setting the bandwidth too high
may disrupt network operations due to the high broadcast packet rate.
Another way to specify the outgoing ARP packet rate is with the
.B --interval
option, which is an alternative way to modify the same underlying parameter.
.PP
The time taken to perform a single-pass scan (i.e. with
.BR --retry=1 )
is given by:
.PP
.nf
time = n*i + t + o
.fi
.PP
Where
.I n
is the number of hosts in the list,
.I i
is the time interval between packets (specified with
.BR --interval ,
or calculated from
.BR --bandwidth ),
.I t
is the timeout value (specified with
.BR --timeout )
and
.I o
is the overhead time taken to load the targets into the list and read the
MAC/Vendor mapping files.
For small lists of hosts, the timeout value will dominate, but for large lists
the packet interval is the most important value.
.PP
With 65,536 hosts, the default bandwidth of 256,000 bits/second (which results in a packet
interval of 2ms), the default timeout of 500ms, and a single pass (
.BR --retry=1 ),
and assuming an overhead of 1 second, the scan would take
65536*0.002 + 0.5 + 1 = 132.57
seconds, or about 2 minutes 13 seconds.
.PP
Any part of the outgoing ARP packet may be modified through the use of the
various
.B --arpXXX
options.  The use of some of these options may make the outgoing ARP packet
non RFC compliant. Different operating systems handle the various non standard
ARP packets in different ways, and this may be used to fingerprint these
systems.  See
.BR arp-fingerprint (1)
for information about a script which uses these options to fingerprint the
target operating system.
.PP
The table below summarises the options that change the outgoing ARP
packet. In this table, the
.I Field
column gives the ARP packet field name from RFC 826,
.I Bits
specifies the number of bits in the field,
.I Option
shows the
.B arp-scan
option to modify this field, and
.I Notes
gives the default value and any other notes.

.PP
.PP
The most commonly used outgoing ARP packet option is
.BR --arpspa ,
which sets the source IP address in the ARP packet.  This option allows
the outgoing ARP packet to use a different source IP address from the
outgoing interface address.  With this option it is possible to use
.B arp-scan
on an interface with no IP address configured, which can be useful if
you want to ensure that the testing host does not interact with the
network being tested.
.PP
.B Warning:
Setting \fIar$spa\fP to the destination IP address can disrupt some
operating systems, as they assume there is an IP address clash if they
receive an ARP request for their own address.
.PP
It is also possible to change the values in the Ethernet frame header
that precedes the ARP packet in the outgoing packets. The table below
summarises the options that change values in the Ethernet frame header.

.PP
.PP
The most commonly used outgoing Ethernet frame option is
.BR --destaddr ,
which sets the destination Ethernet address for the ARP packet.
.B --prototype
is not often used, because it will cause the packet to be interpreted
as a different Ethernet protocol.
.PP
Any ARP responses that are received are displayed in the following format:
.TS
;
L L L.
<IP Address>	<Hardware Address>	<Vendor Details>
.TE
.PP
Where
.B IP Address
is the IP address of the responding target,
.B Hardware Address
is its Ethernet hardware address (also known as the MAC address) and
.B Vendor Details
are the vendor details, decoded from the hardware address.  The output
fields are separated by a single tab character.
.PP
The responses are displayed in the order they are received, which
is not always the same order as the requests were sent because some
hosts may respond faster than others.
.PP
The vendor decoding uses the files
.I ieee-oui.txt
and
.IR mac-vendor.txt ,
which are supplied with
.BR arp-scan .
The
.I ieee-oui.txt
file is generated from the \fIMA-L\fP (OUI), \fIMA-M\fP, \fIMA-S\fP (OUI36) and \fIIAB\fP registries. See
.I https://standards.ieee.org/products-programs/regauth/
for details of these registries.
The Perl script
.B get-oui
which is included in the
.B arp-scan
package can be used to update this file with the latest data from the IEEE
website.
The
.I mac-vendor.txt
file contains other MAC to Vendor mappings that are not covered by
the IEEE OUI file, and can be used to add custom mappings.
.PP
Almost all hosts that support IP will respond to
.B arp-scan
if they receive an ARP packet with the target protocol address
(\fIar$tpa\fP) set to their IP address.  This includes firewalls and
other hosts with IP filtering that drop all IP traffic from
the testing system. For this reason,
.B arp-scan
is a useful tool to quickly determine all the active IP hosts
on a given Ethernet network segment.
.SH OPTIONS
Where an option takes a value, that value is specified as a letter in
angle brackets. The letter indicates the type of data that is expected:
.TP
.B <s>
A character string, e.g. --file=hostlist.txt.
.TP
.B <i>
An integer, which can be specified as a decimal number or as a hexadecimal
number if preceeded with 0x, e.g. --arppro=2048 or --arpro=0x0800.
.TP
.B <f>
A floating point decimal number, e.g. --backoff=1.5.
.TP
.B <m>
An Ethernet MAC address, which can be specified either in the format
01:23:45:67:89:ab, or as 01-23-45-67-89-ab. The alphabetic hex characters
may be either upper or lower case. E.g. --arpsha=01:23:45:67:89:ab.
.TP
.B <a>
An IPv4 address, e.g. --arpspa=10.0.0.1
.TP
.B <h>
Binary data specified as a hexadecimal string, which should not
include a leading 0x. The alphabetic hex characters may be either
upper or lower case. E.g. --padding=aaaaaaaaaaaa
.TP
.B <x>
Something else. See the description of the option for details.
.TP
.BR --help " or " -h
Display this usage message and exit.
.TP
\fB--file\fP=\fI<s>\fP or \fB-f \fI<s>\fR
Read hostnames or addresses from the specified file
instead of from the command line. One name or IP
address per line. Use "-" for standard input.
.TP
.BR --localnet " or " -l
Generate addresses from network interface configuration.
Use the network interface IP address and network mask
to generate the list of target host addresses.
The list will include the network and broadcast
addresses, so an interface address of 10.0.0.1 with
netmask 255.255.255.0 would generate 256 target
hosts from 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.0.255 inclusive.
If you use this option, you cannot specify the \fB--file\fP
option or specify any target hosts on the command line.
The interface specifications are taken from the
interface that arp-scan will use, which can be
changed with the \fB--interface\fP option.
.TP
\fB--retry\fP=\fI<i>\fP or \fB-r \fI<i>\fR
Set total number of attempts per host to \fI<i>\fP,
default=2.
.TP
\fB--timeout\fP=\fI<i>\fP or \fB-t \fI<i>\fR
Set initial per host timeout to \fI<i>\fP ms, default=500.
This timeout is for the first packet sent to each host.
subsequent timeouts are multiplied by the backoff
factor which is set with \fB--backoff\fR.
.TP
\fB--interval\fP=\fI<x>\fP or \fB-i \fI<x>\fR
Set minimum packet interval to \fI<x>\fP.
This controls the outgoing bandwidth usage by limiting
the rate at which packets can be sent. The packet
interval will be no smaller than this number.
If you want to use up to a given bandwidth, then it is
easier to use the \fB--bandwidth\fP option instead.
The interval specified is in milliseconds by default,
or in microseconds if "u" is appended to the value.
.TP
\fB--bandwidth\fP=\fI<x>\fP or \fB-B \fI<x>\fR
Set desired outbound bandwidth to \fI<x>\fP, default=256000.
The value is in bits per second by default. If you
append "K" to the value, then the units are kilobits
per sec; and if you append "M" to the value, the
units are megabits per second.
The "K" and "M" suffixes represent the decimal, not
binary, multiples. So 64K is 64000, not 65536.
You cannot specify both \fB--interval\fP and \fB--bandwidth\fP
because they are just different ways to change the
same underlying parameter.
.TP
\fB--backoff\fP=\fI<f>\fP or \fB-b \fI<f>\fR
Set timeout backoff factor to \fI<f>\fP, default=1.50.
The per-host timeout is multiplied by this factor
after each timeout. So, if the number of retries
is 3, the initial per-host timeout is 500ms and the
backoff factor is 1.5, then the first timeout will be
500ms, the second 750ms and the third 1125ms.
.TP
.BR --verbose " or " -v
Display verbose progress messages.
Use more than once for greater effect:
.IP ""
1 - Display the network address and mask used when the
\fB--localnet\fR option is specified, display any
nonzero packet padding, display packets received
from unknown hosts, and show when each pass through
the list completes.
.IP ""
2 - Show each packet sent and received, when entries
are removed from the list, the pcap filter string,
and counts of MAC/Vendor mapping entries.
.IP ""
3 - Display the host list before scanning starts.
.TP
.BR --version " or " -V
Display program version and exit.
This displays the version, copyright information,
license details, libpcap version, and whether POSIX.1e
capability support is included.
.TP
.BR --random " or " -R
Randomise the host list.
This option randomises the order of the hosts in the
host list, so the ARP packets are sent to the hosts in
a random order. It uses the Knuth shuffle algorithm.
.TP
\fB--randomseed\fP=\fI<i>\fR
Use \fI<i>\fR to seed the pseudo random number generator.
This option seeds the PRNG with the specified number,
which can be useful if you want to ensure that the
random host list is reproducible. By default, the PRNG
is seeded with an unpredictable value. This option is
only effective in conjunction with the \fI--random (-R)\fP
option.
.TP
.BR --numeric " or " -N
IP addresses only, no hostnames.
With this option, all hosts must be specified as
IP addresses. Hostnames are not permitted. No DNS
lookups will be performed.
.TP
\fB--snap\fP=\fI<i>\fP or \fB-n \fI<i>\fR
Set the pcap snap length to \fI<i>\fP. Default=64.
This specifies the frame capture length. This
length includes the data-link header.
The default is normally sufficient.
.TP
\fB--interface\fP=\fI<s>\fP or \fB-I \fI<s>\fR
Use network interface \fI<s>\fP.
If this option is not specified, arp-scan will search
the system interface list for the lowest numbered,
configured up interface (excluding loopback).
The interface specified must support ARP.
.TP
.BR --quiet " or " -q
Only display minimal output. No protocol decoding.
If this option is specified, then only the IP address
and MAC address are displayed for each responding host.
No protocol decoding is performed and the OUI mapping
files are not used.
.TP
.BR --plain " or " -x
Display plain output showing only responding hosts.
This option suppresses the printing of the header and
footer text, and only displays one line for each
responding host. Useful if the output will be
parsed by a script.
.TP
.BR --resolve " or " -d
Resolve IP addresses to hostnames.
Displays the hostname instead of IP address if name
resolution succeeds.
.TP
.BR --ignoredups " or " -g
Don't display duplicate packets.
By default, duplicate packets are displayed and are
flagged with \fI(DUP: n)\fP where \fIn\fP is the number of
times this host has responded.
.TP
\fB--ouifile\fP=\fI<s>\fP or \fB-O \fI<s>\fR
Use IEEE Ethernet OUI to vendor mapping file \fI<s>\fP.
If this option is not specified, the default filename
is \fIieee-oui.txt\fP in the current directory. If that is
not found, then the file
\fI@PKGDATADIR@/ieee-oui.txt\fP is used.
.TP
\fB--macfile\fP=\fI<s>\fP or \fB-O \fI<s>\fR
Use custom Ethernet MAC to vendor mapping file \fI<s>\fP.
If this option is not specified, the default filename
is \fImac-vendor.txt\fP in the current directory. If that is
not found, then the file
\fI@PKGDATADIR@/mac-vendor.txt\fP is used.
.TP
\fB--srcaddr\fP=\fI<m>\fP or \fB-S \fI<m>\fR
Set the source Ethernet MAC address to \fI<m>\fP.
This sets the 48-bit hardware address in the Ethernet
frame header for outgoing ARP packets. It does not
change the hardware address in the ARP packet, see
--arpsha for details on how to change that address.
The default is the Ethernet address of the outgoing
interface.
.TP
\fB--destaddr\fP=\fI<m>\fP or \fB-T \fI<m>\fR
Send the packets to Ethernet MAC address \fI<m>\fP
This sets the 48-bit destination address in the
Ethernet frame header.
The default is the broadcast address \fIff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\fP.
Most operating systems will also respond if the ARP
request is sent to their MAC address, or to a
multicast address that they are listening on.
.TP
\fB--arpsha\fP=\fI<m>\fP or \fB-u \fI<m>\fR
Use \fI<m>\fP as the ARP source Ethernet address
This sets the 48-bit \fIar$sha\fP field in the ARP packet
It does not change the hardware address in the frame
header, see \fB--srcaddr\fP for details on how to change
that address. The default is the Ethernet address of
the outgoing interface.
.TP
\fB--arptha\fP=\fI<m>\fP or \fB-w \fI<m>\fR
Use \fI<m>\fP as the ARP target Ethernet address
This sets the 48-bit \fIar$tha\fP field in the ARP packet
The default is zero, because this field is not used
for ARP request packets.
.TP
\fB--prototype\fP=\fI<i>\fP or \fB-y \fI<i>\fR
Set the Ethernet protocol type to \fI<i>\fP, default=\fI0x0806\fP.
This sets the 16-bit protocol type field in the
Ethernet frame header.
Setting this to a non-default value will result in the
packet being ignored by the target, or sent to the
wrong protocol stack.
.TP
\fB--arphrd\fP=\fI<i>\fP or \fB-H \fI<i>\fR
Use \fI<i>\fP for the ARP hardware type, default=\fI1\fP.
This sets the 16-bit \fIar$hrd\fP field in the ARP packet.
The normal value is \fI1\fP (\fIARPHRD_ETHER\fP). Most, but not
all, operating systems will also respond to \fI6\fP
(\fIARPHRD_IEEE802\fP). A few systems respond to any value.
.TP
\fB--arppro\fP=\fI<i>\fP or \fB-p \fI<i>\fR
Use \fI<i>\fP for the ARP protocol type, default=\fI0x0800\fP.
This sets the 16-bit \fIar$pro\fP field in the ARP packet.
Most operating systems only respond to \fI0x0800\fP (IPv4)
but some will respond to other values as well.
.TP
\fB--arphln\fP=\fI<i>\fP or \fB-a \fI<i>\fR
Set the hardware address length to \fI<i>\fP, default=\fI6\fP.
This sets the 8-bit \fIar$hln\fP field in the ARP packet.
It sets the claimed length of the hardware address
in the ARP packet. Setting it to any value other than
the default will make the packet non RFC compliant.
Some operating systems may still respond to it though.
Note that the actual lengths of the \fIar$sha\fP and \fIar$tha\fP
fields in the ARP packet are not changed by this
option; it only changes the \fIar$hln\fP field.
.TP
\fB--arppln\fP=\fI<i>\fP or \fB-P \fI<i>\fR
Set the protocol address length to \fI<i>\fP, default=\fI4\fP.
This sets the 8-bit \fIar$pln\fP field in the ARP packet.
It sets the claimed length of the protocol address
in the ARP packet. Setting it to any value other than
the default will make the packet non RFC compliant.
Some operating systems may still respond to it though.
Note that the actual lengths of the \fIar$spa\fP and \fIar$tpa\fP
fields in the ARP packet are not changed by this
option; it only changes the ar$pln field.
.TP
\fB--arpop\fP=\fI<i>\fP or \fB-o \fI<i>\fR
Use \fI<i>\fP for the ARP operation, default=\fI1\fP.
This sets the 16-bit \fIar$op\fP field in the ARP packet.
Most operating systems will only respond to the value 1
(ARPOP_REQUEST). However, some systems will respond
to other values as well.
.TP
\fB--arpspa\fP=\fI<a>\fP or \fB-s \fI<a>\fR
Use \fI<a>\fP as the source IP address.
The address should be specified in dotted quad format;
or the literal string "\fIdest\fP", which sets the source
address to be the same as the target host address.
This sets the 32-bit \fIar$spa\fP field in the ARP packet.
Some operating systems check this, and will only
respond if the source address is within the network
of the receiving interface. Others don't care, and
will respond to any source address.
By default, the outgoing interface address is used.
.IP ""
WARNING: Setting \fIar$spa\fP to the destination IP address
can disrupt some operating systems, as they assume
there is an IP address clash if they receive an ARP
request for their own address.
.TP
\fB--padding\fP=\fI<h>\fP or \fB-A \fI<h>\fR
Specify padding after packet data.
Set the padding data to hex value \fI<h>\fP. This data is
appended to the end of the ARP packet, after the data.
Most, if not all, operating systems will ignore any
padding. The default is no padding, although the
Ethernet driver on the sending system may pad the
packet to the minimum Ethernet frame length.
.TP
.BR --llc " or " -L
Use RFC 1042 LLC framing with SNAP.
This option causes the outgoing ARP packets to use
IEEE 802.2 framing with a SNAP header as described
in RFC 1042. The default is to use Ethernet-II
framing.
arp-scan will decode and display received ARP packets
in either Ethernet-II or IEEE 802.2 formats
irrespective of this option.
.TP
\fB--vlan\fP=\fI<i>\fP or \fB-Q \fI<i>\fR
Use 802.1Q tagging with VLAN id \fI<i>\fP.
This option causes the outgoing ARP packets to use
802.1Q VLAN tagging with a VLAN ID of \fI<i>\fP, which should
be in the range 0 to 4095 inclusive.
arp-scan will always decode and display received ARP
packets in 802.1Q format irrespective of this option.
.TP
\fB--pcapsavefile\fP=\fI<s>\fP or \fB-W \fI<s>\fR
Write received packets to pcap savefile \fI<s>\fP.
This option causes received ARP responses to be written
to the specified pcap savefile as well as being decoded
and displayed. This savefile can be analysed with
programs that understand the pcap file format, such as
"tcpdump" and "wireshark".
.TP
.BR --rtt " or " -D
Display the packet round-trip time.
.TP
\fB--limit\fP=\fI<i>\fP or \fB-M \fI<i>\fR
Exit after the specified number of hosts have responded.
When this option is used arp-scan will exit with status 1 if
the number of responding hosts is less then the specified
limit. This can be used in scripts to check if fewer hosts
respond without having to parse the program output.
.TP
\fB--format\fP=\fI<s>\fP or \fB-F \fI<s>\fR
Specify the output format string.
This option specifies the output format. The format
string consists of fields using the syntax
"\fI${field[;width]}\fP". Fields are displayed right-
aligned unless the width is negative in which case
left alignment will be used. The following case-
insensitive field name are recognised:
.sp
.TS
L L .
IP	Host IP address in dotted quad format
Name	Host name if \fB--resolve\fP option given
MAC	Host MAC address xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
HdrMAC	Ethernet source addr if different
Vendor	Vendor details string
Padding	Padding after ARP packet in hex if nonzero
Framing	Framing type if not Ethernet_II
VLAN	802.1Q VLAN ID if present
Proto	ARP protocol if not 0x0800
DUP	Packet number for duplicate packets (>1)
RTT	Round trip time if \fB--rtt\fP option given
.TE
.sp
Only the "\fIip\fP" and "\fImac\fP" fields are available if the
\fB--quiet\fP option is specified.
.sp
Any characters that are not fields are output
verbatim. "\\" introduces escapes:
.sp
.TS
L L .
\\n	newline
\\r	carriage return
\\t	tab
\\	suppress special meaning for following character
.TE
