.SH NAME
arp-scan \- Send ARP requests to target hosts and display responses
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B arp-scan
.RI [ options ] " " [ hosts ...]
.PP
Target hosts must be specified on the command line unless the \fB--file\fP or
\fB--localnet\fP option is used.
.PP
Targets can be IPv4 addresses or hostnames. You can also use CIDR notation
(10.0.0.0/24) (network and broadcast included), ranges (10.0.0.1-10.0.0.10),
and network:mask (10.0.0.0:255.255.255.0).
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBarp-scan\fP sends ARP request packets to the specified hosts and displays
any responses received. The network interface can be specified with the
\fB--interface\fP option. If no interface is specified, \fBarp-scan\fP
will pick the lowest numbered, configured up interface (excluding loopback).
.PP
\fBarp-scan\fP uses raw sockets, which requires privileges on some systems:
.TP
Linux with POSIX.1e capabilities support using libcap:
\fBarp-scan\fP is capabilities aware. It requires \fICAP_NET_RAW\fP in the
permitted set and only enables that capability for the required functions.
use \fIsetcap cap_net_raw+p /path/to/arp-scan\fP to add CAP_NET_RAW to the
permitted set of the arp-scan executable.
Capabilities support also makes SUID root much safer because \fBarp-scan\fP
will drop all capabilities except CAP_NET_RAW and will not run with full root
privileges.
.TP
BSD and macOS:
You need read/write access to \fI/dev/bpf*\fP
.TP
Any operating system:
Running as root or SUID root will work on any OS but other methods are
preferable where possible.
.PP
ARP only operates on the local network, and cannot be routed.
Although the ARP protocol uses IPv4 addresses, it is not an
IP protocol and \fBarp-scan\fP can be used on interfaces without an
IPv4 address.
.PP
One ARP request is sent for each target. If a
host does not respond, the request will be re-sent once more. The number of
retries can be changed with the \fB--retry\fP option. Reducing the number of
retries will reduce the scanning time at the risk of missing some
results due to packet loss.
.PP
You can specify the bandwidth that \fBarp-scan\fP will use
with the \fB--bandwidth\fP option. The default is
256000 bits per second. Increasing the bandwidth will reduce scanning time,
but setting the bandwidth too high may cause a high broadcast packet rate.
Another way to specify the packet rate is with the \fB--interval\fP option.
.PP
The time for a single-pass scan (i.e. with \fB--retry\fP=1) is:
.PP
.EQ
time = n times i + t + o
.EN
.PP
Where \fIn\fP is the number of hosts, \fIi\fP is the interval
(given with \fB--interval\fP or calculated from
\fB--bandwidth\fP), \fIt\fP is the timeout (specified with
\fB--timeout\fP) and \fIo\fP is the overhead time taken to load the target
list and read the MAC/Vendor mapping files. The overhead is normally
negligible (typically around 100ms) but can be reduced further by the
\fB--quiet\fP option.
For small lists of hosts, the timeout value will dominate, but for large lists
the packet interval is the most important value.
.PP
Any part of the ARP request may be modified through the use of the
\fB--arpXXX\fP options as shown in the table below:
.TS

L | L | L | L.

.TE

.PP
.PP
The most common option is \fB--arpspa\fP,
which sets the source IPv4 address in the ARP request, allowing
the ARP request to use a different source address from the
interface address. This allows the use of \fBarp-scan\fP
on interfaces with no IPv4 address.
Note: Setting \fIar$spa\fP to the target's IP address causes some operating
systems to report an address clash when they receive an ARP request for
their own address.
.PP
You can also change the values in the Ethernet frame header as shown below:

.TE
.\" We need two paragraphs under the table to get the correct spacing.
.PP
.PP
The \fB--destaddr\fP option which sets the destination Ethernet address
is the only one that is commonly used.
.PP
By default, ARP responses are displayed in the following format:
.TS
;
L L L.
<IPv4 Address>	<MAC Address>	<Vendor Details>
.TE
.PP
Where \fIIPv4 Address\fP is the IP address of the responding target,
\fIMAC Address\fP is its link-layer address and \fIVendor Details\fP
are the vendor details decoded from the hardware address. The output
fields are separated by a single tab character. You can change the
output format with the \fB--format\fP option.
.PP
The responses are displayed in the order they are received, which
can be different from the order the requests were sent because some
hosts may respond quicker than others.
.PP
The vendor decoding uses the files \fIieee-oui.txt\fP and \fImac-vendor.txt\fP.
\fIieee-oui.txt\fP is generated from the IEEE \fIMA-L\fP (OUI), \fIMA-M\fP,
\fIMA-S\fP (OUI36) and \fIIAB\fP registries.
\fImac-vendor.txt\fP contains additional MAC to Vendor mappings, and can be
used to add custom mappings. \fBget-oui\fP can be used to update
\fIieee-oui.txt\fP with the latest data from the IEEE registries.
.PP
All IPv4 hosts should respond to ARP request packets, including
hosts with packet filtering such as firewalls. This makes \fBarp-scan\fP
a useful tool to discover all active IPv4 hosts on the local network.
.SH OPTIONS
Where an option takes a value, that value is specified as a letter in
angle brackets. The letter indicates the type of data that is expected:

factor which is set with \fB--backoff\fR.
.TP
\fB--interval\fP=\fI<x>\fP or \fB-i \fI<x>\fR
Set minimum packet interval to \fI<x>\fP.
This controls the outgoing bandwidth usage by limiting
the packet rate. If you want to use up to a given
bandwidth it is easier to use the --bandwidth option
instead. The interval is in milliseconds, or
microseconds if "u" is appended.
.TP
\fB--bandwidth\fP=\fI<x>\fP or \fB-B \fI<x>\fR
Set outbound bandwidth to \fI<x>\fP, default=256000.
The value is in bits per second. Append \fIK\fP for
kilobits or \fIM\fP for megabits (decimal multiples). You
cannot specify both \fB--interval\fP and \fB--bandwidth\fP.
.SS "DNS Resolution"
.TP
.BR --numeric " or " -N
Targets must be IP addresses, not hostnames.
Can reduce startup time for large target lists.
.TP
.BR --resolve " or " -d
Resolve responding addresses to hostnames.
The default output format will display the hostname
instead of the IPv4 address. This option makes the
\fI${name}\fP field available for the \fB--format\fP option.
.SS "Output ARP Packet"
.TP
\fB--arpsha\fP=\fI<m>\fP or \fB-u \fI<m>\fR
Set the ARP source Ethernet address.
Sets the 48-bit \fIar$sha\fP field
but does not change the hardware address in the frame
header, see \fB--srcaddr\fP for how to change
that address. Default is the Ethernet address of
the outgoing interface.
.TP
\fB--arptha\fP=\fI<m>\fP or \fB-w \fI<m>\fR
Set the ARP target Ethernet address.
Sets the 48-bit \fIar$tha\fP field.

option; it only changes the \fIar$hln\fP field.
.TP
\fB--arppln\fP=\fI<i>\fP or \fB-P \fI<i>\fR
Set the protocol address length, default=\fI4\fP.
Sets the 8-bit \fIar$pln\fP field.
The lengths of the \fIar$spa\fP and \fIar$tpa\fP
fields are not changed by this
option; it only changes the \fIar$pln\fP field.
.TP
\fB--arpop\fP=\fI<i>\fP or \fB-o \fI<i>\fR
Specify the ARP operation, default=\fI1\fP.
Sets the 16-bit \fIar$op\fP field.
Most operating systems only respond to the value 1
(ARPOP_REQUEST).
.TP
\fB--arpspa\fP=\fI<a>\fP or \fB-s \fI<a>\fR
Set the source IPv4 address.
The address should be in dotted quad format,
or the string "\fIdest\fP" which sets the source
address to the target host address.
The default is the outgoing interface address.
Sets the 32-bit \fIar$spa\fP field.
Some operating systems only respond if the source address
is within the network of the receiving interface.
Setting \fIar$spa\fP to the destination IP address
can cause some operating systems to report
an address clash.
.SS "Output Ethernet Header"
.TP
\fB--srcaddr\fP=\fI<m>\fP or \fB-S \fI<m>\fR
Set the source Ethernet MAC address.
Default is the interface MAC address. This sets the
address in the Ethernet header. It does not change the

unicast address, or to a multicast address they
are listening on.
.TP
\fB--prototype\fP=\fI<i>\fP or \fB-y \fI<i>\fR
Sets the Ethernet protocol type, default=\fI0x0806\fP.
This sets the protocol type field in the Ethernet
header.
.TP
.BR --llc " or " -L

irrespective of this option.
.SS "Misc Options"
.TP
\fB--limit\fP=\fI<i>\fP or \fB-M \fI<i>\fR
Exit after the specified number of hosts have responded.
\fBarp-scan\fP will exit with status 1 if the number of
responding hosts is less than the limit. Can be used
in scripts to check if fewer hosts respond without
having to parse the output.
.TP
\fB--pcapsavefile\fP=\fI<s>\fP or \fB-W \fI<s>\fR
