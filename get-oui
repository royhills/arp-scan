Fetch the Ethernet OUI file from the IEEE website, and save it in the format
used by arp-scan.

'options' is one or more of:
        -h Display this usage message.
        -f FILE Specify the output OUI file. Default=$default_filename
        -u URL Specify the URL to fetch the OUI data from.
           Default=$default_url
        -v Give verbose progress messages.
